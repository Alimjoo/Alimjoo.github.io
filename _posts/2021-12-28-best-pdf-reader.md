I use the macOS default PDF reader `Preview` before, and I got some issue with it recently.
- Search functionality is not good enough;
- Can't remenber the last location correctly;

So I looking for a Replacement. After tried several apps, some is slow, some is bad looking, finally I find this app called [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/). Just fit my apptite.

Here is the [Official Site](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/). And you can download it from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app/files/Skim/Skim-1.6.7/Skim-1.6.7.dmg/download).
