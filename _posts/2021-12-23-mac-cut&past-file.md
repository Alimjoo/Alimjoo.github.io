I have been using macBook for almost 2 years now, and always have an issue when I cut a file and past it somewhere else, but in macOS I can only copy the file, not directly cut the file like Windows or Linux. However I never try to find a solusion to this until today! Here is how :

- First you just need to copy the file you want to cut using shortcut `⌘command + c`
- And go to the directory you want to past the file, and use the shortcut `⌘command + ⌥option + v` instead of `⌘command + v` to past the file here.
- And now you will find that the file in the original directory is gone. This is the way how you cut and past file in macOS.
